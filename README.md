# English_8th_GP
A School Project made on the basis of newly released AI of **Google Gemini Pro**. This uses Gemini Pro API and used it to get the meaning of the word by Gemini and converting into Speech using python library
*pyttsx3*. You can ask any questions from Gemini. 

## Prerequisites
Install all the dependencies mentioned below:-


`pip install google-generativeai`
`#google generative library` 
  
  `pip install flut`
 `#Flut for GUI` 

`pip install pyttxs3`
 `#Speech to Text`


## How to Use?
Just enter your own API key from [Google AI Dev]( ai.google.dev) and enter it and start using.

# Future Improvements
* Making it fully voice accesable
  > Speech to Text libraries are available but they are not that much working they are outputting the wrong text.
* Adding Google Gemini Pro Vision
